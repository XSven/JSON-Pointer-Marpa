CONTRIBUTING

To maintain this module, you have to install its dependencies first. Two
alternative CPAN client invocations that install the prerequisites in the
local/ directory are

  cpanm         --notest  --with-configure --with-develop --no-man-pages --local-lib-contained local --installdeps .
  cpm   install --no-test --with-configure --with-develop                --local-lib-contained local                 --show-build-log-on-failure

It follows the "configure" step that creates a Makefile

  perl Makefile.PL verbose

You may explicitly trigger the "build" step, calling

  make 

before executing all test scripts

  make test   # using Test::Harness (recursive and random)
  make testp  # using TAP::Harness  (recursive and random)

Adding the command-line macro definition

  RELEASE_TESTING=1

to a "test*" target enables the release testing context.

  make disttest

implicitly enables the release testing context (RELEASE_TESTING=1).

  make testlm

executes the last modified test script and

  make cover

creates a test coverage statistics report in vim format.
